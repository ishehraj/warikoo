On this podcast I talked to you about entrepreneurship, how to grow in life, manage personal finances, handle failures and a lot more things that just come to my mind. The episode begins. Most of the emails or messages that I get on a daily basis have one particular word in common. I am confused. I'm confused what to do after school. I'm confused what to do during college. \n\nI'm confused which job to pick. I'm confused should I go to work in India or should I go abroad? I'm confused should I do my masters or should I do my MBA? I'm confused whether I should do a full-time MBA or a distance MBA. I'm confused what I should do in life altogether. I'm confused where I should invest. You get the drift, right? But I don't know what people are expecting when they ask this question. Are they expecting that I will have the answer? Like you want my advice on your life, basis my understanding of your life through your email that you've sent me just six minutes back. How cute is that? I don't have the answer. I generally don't have the answer. I don't think anybody else will. But I do have a question for you because I love questions. And the question is what do you want to do? And I'm fascinated with the responses I get. Oh, I don't know which is the right choice to make. Oh, I'm so confused. Did you hear me? I'm scared that I will make the wrong decision. The world tells me that this is the right path or that's the right path. No, no, no, no, no, no, stop, stop. \n\nYou didn't get my question. I'm not asking you what you should do. I'm not asking you what's the right thing to do. I'm asking you what do you want to do? We all know what we want to do. We may not want to admit it. We may not want to come to terms with it. We may not want to face it. We might be scared of doing what we want to do, but we all know what we want to do. You remember that? I'd rather film me sounding Facebook forward at some point of time, which also then went on to what's happened. It says, Oh, no, so coin. And when it's in the air, that is when your heart will truly tell you what you want. That thing is true. We all know what we want to do. We just don't have the courage to do it. We think the probability of it working out is lower. We do not trust ourselves to follow it through. What we all know, what we want to do. When I ask this question again, it suddenly brings about unexpected clarity because it cuts through the noise. It cuts to the chase. There is no longer any distraction. We simply centered on what we want to do. And then the next question makes it all come together. Well, if this is what you want to do, what's stopping you? What will make it happen for you? As if your life depended on it, not a wish, not a desire, a fact of survival. If the only way you could live was to do the thing that you always wanted to do, but were scared to, trust me, you will find a way to do it. And that's the big thing about questions. They provoke you. They make you think in a way that you perhaps haven't. So I have the same two questions for you. If you're confused in life, about anything in life, what is it that you want to do and what's stopping you? Because when you sit and meditate on this answer, you will get an answer. It will not be the answer that you want, but it will be the answer that you need. And that answer, if you were to take it in your heart and do something about it, will be the best gift that you will give yourself. All the best.

On this podcast I talked to you about entrepreneurship, how to grow in life, manage personal finances, handle failures and a lot more things that just come to my mind. The episode begins. For the longest time, I struggled with giving direct feedback. I felt I was being too harsh, I felt they will feel hurt, they might not like me, they will confront me and I will not know how to defend. A million things used to go on in my head until I read the book Radical Candor. In this brilliant book by Kim Scott, Kim explains four types of feedback and how only one of them is actually effective. And to explain that she uses two determinants. One, do you care personally about the person you're giving feedback to? Whether you're friend, you're relative, you're colleague, whosoever. Because there are often times when you don't care personally about people and there are of course a lot of times where you get deeply about that person. So this is one of the two determinants that she uses. And the second one is, are you direct with that person or not? Or do you twist and turn or sugar coat your feedback? There are people who are direct and there are people who are not. I certainly am not very direct and I've struggled with that all my life. But I still continue to and the combination of these two gave us four different options. So when you think about whether you care personally or not and whether you're direct with that person or not, you get these four quadrants. And let's understand them quickly. First one, let's say you do not care about the person that you're giving feedback to. However, you are very direct when you give that feedback. So if you challenge the person directly but you do not care for that person, it is obnoxious aggression. And we all know how that feels because we have felt it. There are managers who are like that who couldn't care to who it's about who we are and yet will give us direct feedback around what we have to do. The end result of such an approach is instant defensiveness. And that is how we all react when someone tells us, oh, this is wrong. This is what you should have done. This is not the right thing to do. You're losing it. You're not doing enough. They certainly don't care about us or our growth. And they're being very, very direct. So we become defensive. And there is very little change in the person. And by virtue of that, there is very little change that one can expect in the person that is being given this feedback. The second quadrant is if you do not care about the person, but you also do not challenge directly. So you instead sugarcoat or you pretend to be all nice and warm. And if that happens, that is manipulative insensiality. We all have experienced that as well. Somebody that we know does not care about us and yet they pretend to be really nice. And they never direct. They never tell us what's wrong, but they always tell us, oh, they are areas of development. Or there are some things which are really nice about you. And of course, there are some things which are not. But let's not talk about them. What happens because of this? This mistrust. And there is mistrust in everything that they say. Even if they're saying there are things like anymore. And again, there's no change. Nothing happens because of that. Then you think about the third quadrant. If you do care about the person, but you do not challenge directly, then it is runious empathy. Runious empathy is when you are being empathetic because you do care personally about the person. But because you're not direct with that person, you are ruining that person and not helping. It results in ignorance because people don't even know what to fix. If at all, there is anything to fix. And thus, there is no change. This is what I am guilty of for the longest time. It is embedded in my personality that I tend to be runious empathetic as against being what came calls radical candor because it is only when you challenge directly and you care personally about the person you're giving feedback to that it's going to bring in change. Radical candor or RC leads to instant change and needless to say profound in nature. And when I encountered the concept of radical candor, it just hit me hard because now I had a way of managing my guilt of being harsh towards someone I cared for. So today, before I get feedback to anyone that I care personally, I ask myself these three questions that I hope will help you as well in this journey. Question number one, am I saying this because I feel anger or frustration? This is something that I was guilty of a lot and particularly around my group on days. In my group on days, I was managing India, APEC and a lot of what I was saying was just simply anger and frustration because the team in the US had no idea what Asia wants or needs. So they were simply imposing the American standard and the American understanding of how things should be done. And in hindsight, none of those remarks ever helped. It just made them more and more defensive or worse exercise authority if they could because they were, of course, at a higher level than I was and that did not amount to anything but dissonance. So today, I ask a very different question. What is it that they know that I do not? Because that helps me see their side and approach it from that direction and it opens up ways for me to give feedback that's honest and as well direct. Question number two, do I want the other person to truly win or would I feel happy? Watching them lose. I remember being in situations where I actually wanted the person to lose so that I could pinpoint their mistakes, go one up on them and thus establish authority the next time I said something. Today, I make sure that I want them to win in their role by whatever I say because that's what caring personally means. I want them to win. For example, in a relationship, if you were to make a statement which says, do I have to always tell you why I'm angry? That's not helpful. Would you not want the person to win? Because if you do want the person to win, tell them why you're angry. That's it. As simple as that. Because it will only help them get better at what is it you want from them. Instead, if you were to expect that they read your mind and then if they don't, you accuse them of not being able to do so. What is you going down the negative path? And question number three, will this feedback help them or help me? Things that I said which in hindsight only helped me and not them was not feedback. It was just my need to express myself. And when I looked at that chart in the book Radical Candor, it helped me a lot because I realized I was just guilty of Runeus empathy. I was saying things because I wanted to express myself, but in no way was I helping the person that I was telling this to. It is my biggest weakness because I still fall in that trap of wanting to help myself because I want them to feel that I'm a nice person and that is my way of helping myself and in that process I ignore helping them. I've come to believe that most relationships fall to because they never engage in Radical Candor. And I hope this helps you realize where you could be going wrong or where someone you know could be going wrong and you can now through Radical Candor help them. See it.

And for that I want to talk about specifically two things that are often used when somebody's going through a selection of stocks that they have to invest in. And these two matrices are called alpha and beta. Alpha is the order of growth that a stock experiences relative to the index. \n\nSo let's say in the context of India there is a national stock exchange which is considered to be the default index of the country. And let's say it grows at 15% year and year for the last 10 years. And with this particular stock that's grown at 20% year and year in the last 10 years, then the alpha of that stock is 5 because that's 20 minus 15. If there's another stock that's grown at 10% year and year, then the alpha of that stock is minus 5 because it's 10 minus 15 which is the index. But that's half the story. Most of us tend to focus on the growth of the stocks or the degrowth or the lack of growth in the stocks and that's where we stop. And that's why the second metric which is beta becomes important because beta is the measure of volatility or risk in that stock. As compared to the index which goes up and down, up and down, up and down every day, every hour, every second, your stock will also go up and down. And compared to the index, is that more volatile or less volatile. So if the stock has a beta of 1, it means it's exactly as volatile as the index. So when the index goes up by 5%, the stock also tends to go up by 5%. If the index goes down by 5%, the stock also tends to go down by 5%. And the beta instead is not 1 but 2, that means it has a multiple of 2 impact on the volatility. So if the index goes up by 5%, the stock tends to go up by 10%. And if the index falls down by 5%, the index, the stock falls down or tends to fall down by 10%, which is a beta of 2. If it's a beta of 0.5, then for every 5% growth in the index, the stock only grows by about 2.5%. But then for every fall of 5% in the index, the stock falls by 2.5%. And you're wondering why is this podcast about finance? I don't want to hear it. I don't like maths. Well, there's a reason why because go back to the podcast episode name, stocks and life. And that's where the beauty of alpha and beta come in. In life, we take a lot of decisions. Decisions about whether to continue with what we did in college or not. Decisions about whether we should continue in our job or look from another one. Decisions about whether you should get into a relationship with this new person or not. Become friends with this new person or not. Whether you should buy a house or not. Whether you should buy this car or not. Whether you should move countries or not. And all of that is largely taken on the basis of its supposed alpha. We take decision in life based on how we perceive the growth or the outcome or the positive result of that decision working out for us. So if you want to change a job, why are we doing it largely because we see an alpha attached to it that alpha could be in the form of money growth, could be in the form of learning growth, could be in the form of responsibility growth or whatever is it that we fancy but from an alpha perspective. If you want to become friends with someone or enter into a new relationship, that's also alpha because it's growth. You will become a better person. You will have somebody to talk to. You won't be lonely. You will have somebody to share your life with, etc. etc. If you want to change countries, then why are you doing it again, alpha? Your standard of living might increase. Your money might increase. Your exposure might increase so on and so forth. All of those things are just alpha. And it's unfortunate that most decisions that we make in life are centered around alpha without taking into cognizance the role of beta, the risk involved, the volatility involved. I'm not suggesting that you live a life without any risk because that's an impossible life to live. No one can live that. But the smart life to live is not just focus on the high alpha because it may come with high beta instead focus on the high alpha that comes with low beta. In other words, focus on what can give you the maximum possible growth with the least amount of risk that you can take with it. All of life is about maximizing alpha while minimizing beta. The unfortunate thing is we either try to eliminate beta or ignore it and that doesn't work. Let me give you some examples. Most people try to eliminate beta and because of that, we tend to settle for low alpha. The best example of that are fixed deposits. Why do people even park their money in fixed deposits? Knowing very well that that doesn't even beat inflation every single year, your tax adjusted returns are destroying the value of your money because it's low beta. It's no risk. You get the exact same return every single year without any volatility attached. So you love that and you're suddenly willing to trade that and not be worried about the alpha. Wrong choice to make. Why do people settle for low alpha with high beta? These are people who are willing to take unbelievable risks. I would argue unreasonable risks because their assessment of alpha is wrong. They thrive themselves on the risk. They thrive themselves on the adrenaline that they will feel or experience but they very rarely put the effort required behind measuring what could be the right amount of alpha. Why do people go after high alpha, high beta? Why do people invest so much in random cryptocurrencies knowing that they could lose all their money in the hope that they could become a millionaire? Well, because they are drawn in by the high alpha and they'll be like, oh, this stupid coin, this meme coin, this coin that doesn't have any intrinsic value is going to make me a millionaire and I will put all my money behind it without measuring what could be its beta or its volatility or its risk. And it's only the fourth quadrant or the fourth way of living life, which is high alpha, low beta, that makes all the difference. The most successful people that you would know of are the ones who are always optimizing for maximum alpha while minimizing beta. A great example of that is someone who would want to work on a passion project, a side gig, but also recognize that the financial stability they get through their current job cannot be denied. So they will stay in their job, make sure that that pays the bills and the nights their weekends, their holidays, all of that free time is going to be devoted towards the side gig. And over a period of time, one year, two years, they will break out and they will make shit happen for themselves. That will be the high alpha, but it came at much lower beta than would have otherwise if they would have just quit their job and followed their passion, which is what most people will suggest you do because that's hashtag motivation. Doesn't work. This can teach you something valuable about life and this is what it is. Live life with the highest level of alpha and the lowest level of beta. And if you were to think of every single decision in your life through this lens, you will be a change person. I guarantee you that. All the best.

With little change in the person we gave the feedback to. \n\nBottom Left Quadrant:  \nIf you do not care about the person but you do not challenge directly either, instead sugar coat and pretend to be all nice and warm - that is manipulative insincerity.  \n  \nMost toxic relationships lie here.  \nThis results in mistrust and again, no change! \n\nTop Left Quadrant:  \nIf you do care about the person, but do not challenge directly, it is ruinous empathy.  \n  \nIt results in ignorance (people do not even know what to fix, if at all to fix anything) and thus no change.  \n  \nThis is what I was guilty of, for the longest time! \n\nTop Right Quadrant:  \nIt is ONLY when you challenge directly AND you care personally about the person you are giving feedback - that it is Radical Candor.  \n  \nRC leads to instant change and needless to say, profound in nature!  \n  \nThe book hit me hard. \n\nBecause now I had a way of managing my guilt of being harsh towards someone I cared for.  \n  \nSo today, before giving any feedback to any of my known ones, I ask these 3 questions: \n\nQuestion 1: Am I saying this because I feel anger or frustration?  \n  \nI was guilty of this during my Groupon days.  \n  \nWhere a lot of what I said was simply anger/frustration because the US team had no idea what Asia needs or wants and they were simply imposing the US understanding. \n\nIn hindsight - none of those remarks ever helped.  \n  \nIt just made them more defensive or exercise authority if they could.  \nNow, I ask a different question:  \n“What is it that they know that I do not?”  \nThat helps me see their side and approach it from that direction. \n\nQuestion 2: Do I want the other person to truly win, or would I feel happy watching them lose?  \n  \nI found myself in situations where I wanted the person to lose, so that I could pin point their mistakes, go one up on them and thus establish authority the next time I said something. \n\nToday, I make sure that I want them to win by whatever I say.  \n  \nFor ex:  \n\"You do not even know why I am angry\" - is an unfair statement to make.  \nIt makes it sound like you WANT the other person to forget, and use that as an excuse to remind them of their failure. \n\nQuestion 3: Will this feedback help them or help me?  \n  \nThings that I said which, in hindsight helped only me and not them, was not feedback.  \nIt was just my need to express myself.  \nThe chart above helped me a lot.  \n  \nI am most guilty of ruinous empathy. \n\nIt’s my biggest weakness because I still fall in that trap.  \n  \nOf wanting to help myself (they should feel I am a nice person), than helping them!  \n  \nI have come to believe that most relationships falter because they never engage in Radical Candor. \n\nI hope this helped you realize where you could be going wrong.  \n  \nOr, where someone you know could be going wrong and you can now, through Radical Candor, help them see it :) \n\nCandor is a compliment.  \nIt implies equality.  \nIt is how true friends talk.  \n  \n- Peggy Noonan \n\nEvery week, I write a thread on life, failure, success, productivity or startups - things that I actively care about.  \n  \nFollow me on [@warikoo](https://twitter.com/warikoo) to be notified of my threads and tweets. \n\nAnd if you liked the thread, please consider retweeting the original tweet, so that it reaches more people.  \n  \nI have pasted the original tweet below, for your convenience.","lastmodified":"2022-11-11T09:17:47.169004995Z","tags":null},"/notes/twitter/My-Productivity-Hacks":{"title":"My Productivity Hacks","content":"My Productivity Hacks\n\nA thread...\n\n---\n\nProductivity Hack #1  \nNot try to remember anything\n\nI consciously and obsessively try to NOT remember things.  \nSo that my mind dispenses the least amount of energy in remembering tasks or even context.\n\n---\n\nHence, I carry a notebook with me always.  \nI take notes like a school student  \nI put tasks in a calendar  \nI send myself emails in the future\n\nMy mind's energy should be spent in thinking.  \nNot remembering!\n\n---\n\nProductivity Hack #2  \nDocument EVERYTHING!\n\nAt any point I have 3 notebooks  \n1.
