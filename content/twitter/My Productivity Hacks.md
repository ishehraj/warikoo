My Productivity Hacks

A thread...

Productivity Hack #1  
Not try to remember anything

I consciously and obsessively try to NOT remember things.  
So that my mind dispenses the least amount of energy in remembering tasks or even context.

---

Hence, I carry a notebook with me always.  
I take notes like a school student  
I put tasks in a calendar  
I send myself emails in the future

My mind's energy should be spent in thinking.  
Not remembering!

---

Productivity Hack #2  
Document EVERYTHING!

At any point I have 3 notebooks  
1. Ideas  
2. Todos lists for the day  
3. Meeting notes

And I write down things.

Writing helps tell the brain that this is important.  
And it helps me not "try and remember" anything.

Productivity Hack #3  
I put everything on a calendar

My calendar is my lifeline.  
Everything is on my calendar.  
Bills to pay, birthdays to remember, threads to write, weekly routines.

---

This is my calendar screenshot for next week.

50%+ of my waking time goes towards things that are important, but not urgent! :)

Productivity Hack #4  
I schedule emails to myself, for the future

There are so many things that interest me, that it becomes important to prioritize.  
And for me prioritization is about scheduling.

Future emails serve that purpose.

---

For instance, this is an email I had sent to myself last Nov. This is SO powerful.  
I don't have to add this to my mental bandwidth.  
I schedule it for a time when I think I will have the bandwidth.  
If I don't - no sweat - I snooze it!

Productivity Hack #5  
Using technology for everything possible

There are a lot of tasks that suck your time, but do not make you move forward.  
Consider using technology to solve for them.

---

Simple things such as template replies for your emails (see attached), managing your calendar (I use [@xdot](https://twitter.com/XDot)), setting recurring emails (I use [@baydin](https://twitter.com/baydin)), organizing my thoughts (I use [@NotionHQ](https://twitter.com/NotionHQ))
